# Installation Notes for Windows:
# 1. Install PyTorch with CUDA support first:
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#
# 2. Install ffmpeg separately:
#    Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and add to PATH
#
# 3. For MediaPipe issues, we use YOLO models as alternative
#
# 4. Some models may require manual downloads:
#    - BiRefNet-HR: huggingface.co/ZhengPeng7/BiRefNet
#    - BRIA RMBG 2.0: huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-2.0
#    - Real-ESRGAN models: Use built-in alternatives
#
# 5. For ComfyUI integration, ensure ComfyUI is installed separately
#
# 6. If any package fails to install, comment it out and the pipeline
#    will use fallback methods
